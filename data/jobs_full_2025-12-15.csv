COUNTRY PROFILE
Uganda is currently hosting close to 2 million refugees and asylum seekers, the largest number in the region. Most have fled civil unrest and conflicts in South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Sudan, Somalia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and others. Refugee flows into Uganda are likely to continue due to ongoing conflicts, violent wars, political unrest and human rights violations in countries in the region. The vast majority of refugees are hosted in settlements in 12 refugee-hosting districts in northern and mid/south-western Uganda, while 8% of reside in urban Kampala.
In Uganda, the response coordination is held by UNHCR and by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM). The Uganda government, with support from humanitarian partners, has maintained a relatively welcoming policy for all asylum seekers and prima facie refugees. The asylum seekers, once registered as refugees, receive a plot of land in one of the refugee settlements and general food assistance from WFP. Urban self-settlement in Kampala and secondary cities is also common. In the past years (2025 in particular) Uganda’s refugee response has been affected by a general trend of decreasing humanitarian funds which have increasingly necessitated prioritization of humanitarian assistance. Simultaneously, the within the humanitarian-development Nexus space, the Transition/Integration agenda and strategy play a key role, with the intent of gradually increasingly sharing or transferring service provision with/to government, especially in terms of WASH, Education, and Health.

2025-12-15,Agent Operations Territory Lead,Wave Mobile Money,"Abidjan, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire","Our mission
We're making Africa the first cashless continent.
In 2017, over half the population in Sub-Saharan Africa had no bank account. That's for good reason—the fees are too high, the closest branch can be miles away, and nobody takes cards. Without access to financial institutions, people are forced to keep their savings under the mattress. Small business owners rely on lenders who charge extortionate rates. Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.
We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave. In 2017, we launched a mobile app in Senegal for cash deposit, withdrawal, and peer-to-peer and business payments. Now, we have millions of users across 9 countries and are growing fast.
Our goal is to make Africa the first cashless continent and that's where you come in...
How you'll help us achieve it
Wave is now the largest financial institution in Senegal, with over 7 million users. And, we're still in the early days of our product roadmap and potential impact on people's everyday lives.
We are hiring an Agent Operations Territory Lead to manage product rollouts and supervise agents in a designated territory. You will also represent Wave, oversee our distribution and marketing, interact with users, and conduct interviews with individuals about their needs and concerns related to money transfer and financial services.
In This Role, You Will
Manage agent recruitment by leading a team of agent openers who will recruit and train agents within your territory.
Ensure agent quality by ensuring all your agents comply with all legal and policy requirements and have executed valid contracts.
Continue to ensure agent quality by ensuring your agents are fully trained on critical elements, such as agent applications, the contents of the contract before signing, rebalancing options, fraud management, and other relevant topics.
Collaborate with the BTL team to ensure all your agents are well-branded and have the necessary supplies.
Coordinate agent liquidity management by monitoring the cash and float availability at agent locations in cooperation with our liquidity team.
Manage risk through routine visits to report emerging issues and assess the performance of agents in your territory.
Identify underperforming agents, close their accounts, recover Wave items and equipment, and ensure that branding materials are removed.
Be the primary contact for all agency networks acquiring and using Wave products in your territory.
Champion excellent customer service among distributors and agents within your territory.
Key Details
Location: You'll be based in Abidjanand may travel to field locations.
You must have work authorization in Côte d’Ivoire.

À l’UNICEF, nous sommes engagés, passionnés et fiers de ce que nous faisons, aussi longtemps que notre action est nécessaire. Promouvoir les droits de chaque enfant n’est pas simplement un métier – c’est une vocation.
L’UNICEF est un lieu où les carrières se construisent : nous offrons à notre personnel une diversité d’opportunités de développement professionnel et personnel, qui leur permettent de renforcer leur sentiment d’utilité tout en servant les enfants et les communautés à travers le monde.

Pour chaque enfant, le droit a la Protection
La mission fondamentale de l'UNICEF est de promouvoir les droits de chaque enfant, partout, dans tout ce que fait l'organisation - dans les programmes, dans les activités de plaidoyer et dans les opérations. La stratégie d'équité, qui met l'accent sur les enfants et les familles les plus défavorisés et exclus, traduit cet engagement en faveur des droits de l'enfant en actes. Pour l'UNICEF, l'équité signifie que tous les enfants ont la possibilité de survivre, de se développer et d'atteindre leur plein potentiel, sans discrimination, préjugés ou favoritisme. Dans la mesure où un enfant n'a pas de chances égales dans la vie - dans ses dimensions sociales, politiques, économiques, civiques et culturelles - ses droits sont violés. Il est de plus en plus évident qu'investir dans la santé, l'éducation et la protection des citoyens les plus défavorisés d'une société – en s'attaquant aux inégalités – donnera non seulement à tous les enfants la possibilité de réaliser leur potentiel, mais conduira également à une croissance soutenue et à la stabilité des pays. C'est pourquoi il est si essentiel de mettre l'accent sur l'équité. Il accélère les progrès vers la réalisation des droits de l'homme de tous les enfants, ce qui est le mandat universel de l'UNICEF, tel qu'il est défini dans la Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant, tout en soutenant le développement équitable des nations.

💼 The Opportunity (For Business-Minded Individuals Only)

We are currently looking for a Senior Finance and Compliance Officer to join our team in Nigeria.
Position: Senior
Finance and Compliance Officer
Contract duration:
6 months (subject to funding confirmation)
Starting Date:
2 March 2026 (tentative)
Location:
Abuja, Nigeria (with occasional regional travel to Dakar)
Deadline to apply:
31st December, 2025.
COUNTRY PROFILE
Nigeria is confronted by multiple security challenges. The Insurgency of The Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Jamā'at Ahl as-Sunnah lid-Da'wah wa'l-Jihād (JAS) – more popularly known as Boko Haram – has entered its twelfth year and has spawned a humanitarian crisis rendering sections of Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe state inaccessible, limiting affected population`s access to basic infrastructure and services, and displacing millions. In the Northwest, banditry has emerged as a key challenge, becoming more sanguinary with every year. The high levels of crime and increased use of violence and kidnappings have led parents and authorities to pull millions of students out of school. The spotlight remains on the Northeast yet needs – both humanitarian and developmental – are rising in the Northwest, long-running discontent and militancy prevails in the Niger Delta, discontent is increasing between herders and farming communities spreading from the central belt southwards, and separatist Biafra agitations in the Igbo Southeast simmer on.
Against this backdrop, IMPACT Initiatives has developed a wide range of research cycles to provide an evidence-base for the humanitarian community. Historically, IMPACT Initiatives has been present in both the Northeast and Northwest of Nigeria. Thematically, across 2021 – 2023 IMPACT Initiatives fielded Multi-Sectoral Needs Assessments (MSNAs), Hard to Reach(H2R) assessments, Area Based Assessments (ABA), Rapid Overviews of Areas of Return(ROAR), Thematic Assessments (TA), Rapid Assessments (RA), and WASH Infrastructure Mapping, while also playing a key role in Famine Monitoring, Nutrition and Food Security Surveillance, and the Joint Market Monitoring Initiative (JMMI).
FUNCTION
The position is initially recruited for the Third-Party Monitoring (TPM) Project covering FCDOs Humanitarian and Resilience Programme (HARP). For this programme, IMPACT has entered into a consortium with FACT Foundation. While in Nigeria, the staff shall be seconded to and hosted by FACT for their mission. The programmatic portfolio in Nigeria is expected to grow in 2026 beyond the FCDO TPM Project, meaning a closer finance and compliance oversight will likely be needed. In addition, there are further finance and compliance responsibilities at a regional level that the position will need to support with. This will involve close collaboration with IMPACT’s Regional Finance Manager for the West African Region and occasional travel to Dakar, Senegal.
Under the management of IMPACT’s Country Coordinator, the Senior Finance and Compliance Officer will therefore be responsible for ensuring sound financial management, transparency, and compliance with internal policies and donor requirements. This role involves financial reporting, internal audits, risk mitigation, and ensuring adherence to donor and organizational policies.

Reporting To
Founder / Head of Product / CEO
Role Overview
We are looking for a senior, founding UX/UI Designer—our first design hire—who will own
end-to-end design across product, brand, and experience.
This is not a narrow UX role. You will help shape how the product looks, feels, and works,
while setting the foundations for design culture, quality, and systems. You’ll work closely with
the founder, engineers, and stakeholders to translate vision into intuitive, elegant, and scalable
experiences.
You’ll balance strategic UX thinking, strong visual and UI craft, and hands-on execution,
with the confidence to make decisions in ambiguity and move fast without compromising
quality.
Key Responsibilities:
Product & Experience Design
Own the end-to-end design process, from discovery and concept to detailed UX, UI, and
delivery
Translate product vision, business goals, and user needs into clear, intuitive user journeys
and flows
Design thoughtful, user-centered experiences that balance usability, emotion, and
aesthetics
Partner closely with engineering to ensure feasibility, quality, and consistency in
execution
UI & Visual Design Excellence
Create high-quality UI designs with strong attention to typography, layout, color,
hierarchy, and interaction
Establish and evolve a visual design language that feels distinctive, premium, and
scalable
Ensure design outputs feel intentional, polished, and crafted—not generic or template-
driven
Push creative boundaries while staying grounded in usability and product constraints
Systems &amp; Foundations
Define and build the initial design system (components, patterns, tokens, guidelines)
Create templates, standards, and workflows that support consistency and speed as the
product grows
Lay the groundwork for future designers to build on, even if you’re a team of one today
Collaboration &amp; Influence
Act as a design partner to the founder and leadership—challenging ideas, not just
executing them
Communicate design decisions clearly using rationale rooted in user needs and business
impact
Advocate for design quality and user experience across the organization
Collaborate cross-functionally with product, engineering, marketing, and leadership
Leadership & Ownership
Take full ownership of design outcomes—strategy, craft, and execution
Be comfortable operating in ambiguity, making decisions, and iterating quickly
Help define what “great design” means for the company from day one
What We’re Looking For:
Experience & Background
7+ years of experience in UX/UI or Product Design, ideally in digital products or
platforms
Experience working as a senior or lead designer, preferably in startups or fast-moving
environments
Comfortable being the first or only designer, owning everything from strategy to pixels
UX Skills
Strong grounding in user-centered design principles and problem framing
Experience designing complex flows, end-to-end journeys, and scalable experiences
Confident in making UX decisions without over-reliance on heavy process
UI & Creative Strength
Exceptional visual design and UI craft—this role requires strong taste and execution
Ability to create clean, modern, and distinctive interfaces with personality
Strong sense of typography, spacing, color, and interaction design
Comfortable pushing beyond safe or generic patterns when appropriate
Mindset & Traits
Builder mentality—you enjoy creating things from scratch
Strategic thinker who can zoom out, but also loves getting into the details
Opinionated but open—able to defend ideas while remaining collaborative
High ownership, accountability, and pride in craft
Curious, adaptable, and motivated by impact rather than hierarchy
Bonus Points
Experience defining products at early-stage or 0→1 companies
Brand or creative design background alongside product/UX experience
Experience shipping and iterating live products
Familiarity with front-end constraints and strong collaboration with engineers
Experience setting up design systems from scratch
Tools
You’re likely comfortable with tools such as:
Figma (required)
Prototyping tools (Figma, Framer, Principle, ProtoPie, etc.)
Design system management
(Tools matter less than outcomes—we care about craft and thinking.)
Why This Role
You’ll shape the design direction from day one
You’ll work directly with leadership and have real influence on the product
Your work will be highly visible and impactful

We’re
Nonsensical
, a creative agency that lives and breathes TikTok. Everything we do is focused on making content that feels native, fun, and impossible to scroll past.
We work with brands, creators, and teams who want to show up on TikTok in a smarter, fresher way - and we help them do it with edits that cut through the noise.
We move fast, experiment often, and keep things human.
We shout people out when they win, we run weekly all-agency wrap-ups so everyone stays connected, and we hand out a paid award every week to someone who lived our values: honesty, passion, and being creative and curious.

Senior TikTok Video Editor

Your main responsibilities will be:
🔥 Edit high-performing TikTok-first videos across multiple brands
🔥 Turn raw creator footage into platform-native, optimised content
🔥 Add captions, graphics, hooks, sound design, and TikTok-style pacing
🔥 Work with UK-based producers to refine scripts, storylines, and cuts

🔥 Hit tight deadlines without losing creativity
🔥 Manage several projects at once and stay in sync with our content calendar
🔥 Occasionally advise creators on best-practice filming approaches
Working hours: full-time, 9:00–17:30 UK time.
You’ll report to our Head of Content. At the moment that’s Sarah - she runs a TikTok page about the West Midlands. She’s transitioning into a new role and we’re finalising her replacement, but you’ll be joining a team that values clarity, creativity, and a good laugh.
About You
Here are the must-haves:
✅ 2+ years editing TikTok-first vertical videos (agency or creator background)
✅ Expert in Adobe Premiere Pro and CapCut
✅ Strong instinct for TikTok pacing, hooks, retention, and storytelling
✅ Able to turn mediocre footage into great content
✅ Experience editing for multiple brands or creators at once
✅ Reliable, organised, and comfortable working asynchronously with a UK team
✅ Solid understanding of TikTok trends, transitions, and platform nuances
Brownie points:
⭐ Motion graphics or light animation skills
⭐ Experience with influencers, UGC creators, or TikTok Shop content
⭐ Experience editing for US or UK audiences
⭐ Eye for thumbnails, captions, and wider creative ideas
⭐ Understanding TikTok Ads best practices
⭐ Ability to suggest new editing techniques or visual ideas
The ideal candidate is detail-obsessed, proactive, calm under pressure, and creatively curious. They experiment often, stay reliable even on tight deadlines, communicate clearly, and handle quick feedback without drama.
They understand TikTok culture inside out, love solving editing problems, and bring positive energy to every project.

2025-12-15,Customer Success Manager (Google Ads - eCom) (Remote),Ad-Lab,"Western Cape, South Africa","About the Role
We’re looking for a Client Success & Account Lead to fully own a portfolio of eCommerce clients.
You’ll be the go-to person for the client and the internal captain who works with our Google Ads Strategists and Media Buyers to make sure accounts are performing, communication is tight, and nothing falls through the cracks.
If you love Google Ads, talking to clients, and driving clear outcomes (ROAS, revenue, profit) – this is for you.
What You’ll Own
1. Client Relationship & Communication
Be the primary point of contact for your client portfolio.
Run recurring check-in calls (weekly/bi-weekly/monthly), Loom updates, and strategy reviews.
Translate complex performance data into simple, clear, business-language the client understands.
Proactively manage expectations, timelines, and next steps.
2. Account & Performance Ownership
Work closely with our Google Ads Strategists & Media Buyers to ensure campaigns are aligned with the client’s goals (MER, ROAS, CAC, profit).
Review performance across accounts regularly and push the team on optimisations, tests, and scaling opportunities.
Spot issues early (conversion tracking, feed problems, drops in performance) and coordinate fast fixes.
3. Strategy & Planning
Help build and present quarterly and monthly strategies: budgets, scaling plans, testing roadmaps, new channels (Pmax, YouTube, etc.).
Understand the client’s wider business (margins, LTV, seasonality, stock, promos) and reflect that in the ad strategy.
Bring ideas to clients: new offers, funnels, landing pages, creatives, and experiments.
4. Reporting & Insight
Own performance reporting: weekly or monthly reports, Loom walk-throughs, and QBR decks where needed.
Focus on insight, not just screenshots – what happened, why it happened, and what we’re doing next.
Use dashboards / tools (GA4, Looker/Datastudio, Google Ads UI, etc.) to support decisions.
5. Retention, Growth & Upsell
Keep a pulse on client satisfaction and step in early if you sense churn risk.
Identify opportunities to grow accounts: higher budgets, additional services, new markets, YouTube, etc.
Aim to turn every account into a long-term partnership, not a short-term “vendor” relationship.
6. Internal Coordination & Process
Make sure tasks, priorities, and deadlines are clear for the internal team (usually via ClickUp/Slack/Loom).
Keep everyone aligned on what matters this week for each account (big rocks, tests, fixes).
Help maintain a high standard of client communication, documentation, and follow-through.
Requirements
Experience:
3+ years working with Google Ads for eCommerce brands (agency side strongly preferred).

2025-12-15,"Intermediate Site Reliability Engineer, Environment Automation",GitLab,South Africa,"GitLab is an open-core software company that develops the most comprehensive AI-powered DevSecOps Platform, used by more than 100,000 organizations. Our mission is to enable everyone to contribute to and co-create the software that powers our world. When everyone can contribute, consumers become contributors, significantly accelerating human progress.

Co-create the future with us as we build technology that transforms how the world develops software.
An overview of this role
You'll join the Dedicated team as a Site Reliability Engineer focused on Environment Automation, where your work will help power hundreds of isolated GitLab environments for our customers. In this role, you'll help keep these environments reliable, scalable, secure, and consistent by treating everything as code and contributing to automation across the entire lifecycle, from initial provisioning to day-to-day operations. Instead of operating a single platform, you'll collaborate with senior SREs to solve the unique challenges of managing many tenant environments in parallel, each with its own constraints and integration points.
You'll help define, deploy, and maintain GitLab environments across cloud providers using infrastructure as code, deployment packages, and Kubernetes. You'll contribute to automation that reduces manual work, assist in building tooling that orchestrates upgrades and configuration changes safely at scale, and support an observability stack that lets us understand and improve the health of every environment. Your work will directly impact how customers experience GitLab Dedicated and other managed offerings, enabling them to focus on building software while we ensure their GitLab environments are always production ready.
Some Examples Of Work You'll Do
Contribute to the design and evolution of infrastructure automation using Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes to provision, upgrade, and operate many GitLab environments with minimal manual effort
Help debug and resolve production issues across Kubernetes clusters, GitLab components, and cloud services, then assist in building automation and safeguards that prevent similar issues from recurring
Assist in creating and maintaining deployment and orchestration tools, such as Helm Charts, omnibus-gitlab configurations, and multi-tenant workflows, that make it easy for teams to manage GitLab environments at scale
What you'll do
Contribute to automating operational tasks across many GitLab environments, from initial provisioning and configuration updates to upgrades and routine maintenance, helping reduce manual work and improve reliability at scale under the guidance of senior team members.
Help build and refine the observability stack for multi-tenant GitLab environments so we monitor the right signals across Kubernetes, cloud services, and GitLab applications, supporting early issue detection and basic capacity tracking.
Assist in responding to platform alerts and incidents, collaborating with Environment Automation SREs and engineering teams to troubleshoot production issues across multiple tenants and document findings.
Support planning and implementation of infrastructure changes, capacity expansions, and new service rollouts for Dedicated and other managed GitLab environments, contributing to efforts that improve resource efficiency and environment isolation.
Develop and maintain scripts, automation tools, and infrastructure-as-code workflows that manage parts of the GitLab environment lifecycle, enabling more repeatable, self-service operations over time.
Apply and help implement best practices for running GitLab on Kubernetes and cloud platforms, focusing on day-to-day reliability, performance, and security while learning how to keep environments consistent.
Participate in the on-call rotation for production GitLab environments with appropriate support, helping triage and mitigate incidents across clusters and cloud providers and contributing to post-incident reviews.
Document operational tasks, runbooks, and lessons learned so they become clear, repeatable processes and can be candidates for future automation, improving shared knowledge and reducing manual toil across the team.
What you'll bring
Experience working as an SRE or in a similar role operating production infrastructure, with an interest in automating the lifecycle of many environments or tenants in parallel, even if you have not yet done so at large scale.
Hands-on experience running Kubernetes-based workloads in production, including basic understanding of deployments, rollouts, and debugging common issues like crash loops, failed health checks, and scheduling problems.
Familiarity with infrastructure automation and configuration management tools such as Terraform and Ansible, including experience working with modules, variables, and managing state safely for multiple environments.
Solid understanding of Git-based workflows and infrastructure-as-code practices, with the ability to contribute to reusable modules, templates, and pipelines that make automation safer and more consistent.
Experience working in distributed systems or cloud-based production environments, ideally in SaaS or managed service settings, with comfort participating in incident response and on-call rotations under guidance from more senior team members.
A proactive mindset focused on automation and documentation—you look for opportunities to remove manual steps, improve runbooks, and turn repetitive tasks into reliable, self-service tools.
Comfort working asynchronously across distributed teams and a desire to contribute to GitLab's values of collaboration, transparency, and iteration.
Basic programming skills in languages such as Go or Ruby are valuable but not required; we welcome candidates with diverse technical backgrounds and transferable skills, especially those experienced in reading, debugging, or contributing to infrastructure tooling.
About The Team
We are responsible for building, running, and evolving the entire lifecycle of the GitLab environments that power the GitLab Dedicated platform. You'll be part of our team focused on owning the reliability, scalability, performance, and security of automated single-tenant GitLab instances and their supporting services. GitLab Dedicated provides fully managed, isolated environments for customers around the world, which means your work directly impacts how organizations of all sizes run their mission-critical software delivery on GitLab. We operate in a fully distributed, asynchronous environment across multiple regions, collaborating on everything from infrastructure automation and environment lifecycle design to incident response and capacity planning. You'll be solving novel challenges at scale, from orchestrating infrastructure-as-code workflows across hundreds of tenants to designing the automation that keeps those environments consistent, secure, and up to date. We continuously seek to reduce complexity and improve efficiency by leveraging cloud vendor managed products and services where appropriate, ensuring GitLab Dedicated remains a best-in-class managed platform for our customers. For more on how we operate, see the relevant GitLab Dedicated and infrastructure handbook pages.
