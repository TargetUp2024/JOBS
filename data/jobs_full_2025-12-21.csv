Position Summary
Our jobs aren’t just about putting food on the table that our guests will enjoy until they ask for their bill. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with food and drinks on the side. Our Guest Service Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their meal. Whether setting tables, communicating with the kitchen, interacting and serving guests, or cleaning work areas and supplies, the Guest Service Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

2025-12-21,December,"Cairo Cabin Crew Opportunities (Dubai Based, Relocation Provided)",Emirates,"Cairo, Egypt","Job Purpose
A personality that shines, the ability to adapt to any situation and make people feel at ease. These are a few of the qualities we’re looking for in our cabin crew.
As the face of Emirates, you’ll be the person customers turn to for help and direction when they fly with us, so you need to be friendly, observant and able to provide the right support.
Being a member of the cabin crew is so much more than a service role - safety is our highest priority. You’ll need to lead confidently and take control when it comes to managing aircraft services, security, and safety procedures. This comes from the world-class learning experience our crew receive at our state-of-the-art facility in Dubai.
Qualifications & Experience
Here are some other things we look for in our cabin crew:
You’ve had more than a year’s experience in hospitality/customer service
You have a positive attitude and the natural ability to provide excellent service in a team environment, dealing with people from many cultures
Your minimum qualification is high school graduate (Grade 12)
You need to be fluent in written and spoken English (ability to speak another language is an advantage)
You’re at least 160cm tall and can reach 212 cm while standing on tiptoes, to enable you to reach emergency equipment on all aircraft types
No visible tattoos while you’re in Emirates cabin crew uniform (without covering them with bandages or cosmetics)
As Emirates cabin crew, you’ll be based in Dubai and will need to meet the UAE's employment visa requirements
Aside from the requirements of the role, you should be determined to always perform to the highest standards, focus on being solution oriented, and be able to manage a demanding work schedule. You should have the ability to deliver an authentic experience to our customers. You’ll be culturally aware and reflect the Emirates personality - professional, empathetic, progressive, visionary and cosmopolitan.

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida). Nuestros Expertos de servicio al huésped toman la iniciativa a la hora de ofrecer toda una serie de servicios orientados a que el huésped disfrute la experiencia. Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.
Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida). Nuestros Expertos de servicio al huésped toman la iniciativa a la hora de ofrecer toda una serie de servicios orientados a que el huésped disfrute la experiencia. Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.
Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

Position Summary
Our jobs aren’t just about putting food on the table that our guests will enjoy until they ask for their bill. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with food and drinks on the side. Our Guest Service Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their meal. Whether setting tables, communicating with the kitchen, interacting and serving guests, or cleaning work areas and supplies, the Guest Service Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
Preferred Qualifications
Education: High school diploma or G.E.D. equivalent.
Related Work Experience: Less than 1 year related work experience.
Supervisory Experience: No supervisory experience.
License or Certification: None

Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse).

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida). Nuestros Expertos de servicio al huésped toman la iniciativa a la hora de ofrecer toda una serie de servicios orientados a que el huésped disfrute la experiencia. Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.
Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

Position Summary
As the original house of luxury, St. Regis continues to redefine modern luxury through service. At the core is the Butler program, an icon to our heritage and the heart and soul of new luxury. It is high-touch, personalized, creative and original. It is brought to life by all talent but serving as the primary face to the program is our Butler team, who are the ultimate luxury ambassadors.
The Butler provides bespoke experiences and services to fulfill all guest needs during pre-arrival, check-in, throughout the stay and upon departure, in partnership with other departments in the hotel operation. This includes coordinating efforts of Butler Valets, and verifying that other departments supporting butler services are equipped to meet guest needs. The Butler is key to building rapport with guests, proactively anticipate guest needs and acting upon them where possible.
While the St. Regis brand is steeped in history with roots that can be traced back to the early 1900s, every team member is part of a trailblazing future to redefine modern luxury through service. The Butler’s success is rooted in a deep passion for service, uncompromising standards, the ability to anticipate needs and impeccable interpersonal skills.
You will also be expected to create a safe workplace, follow company policies and procedures, uphold quality standards, and ensure your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Butler team members will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Butler team members – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
Preferred Qualifications
Education: High school diploma or G.E.D. equivalent.
Supervisory Experience: No supervisory experience.
License or Certification: None
Required Qualifications
Related Work Experience: 6-months related work experience required.

Nos experts en Service client font preuve d'initiative et offrent un vaste éventail de services afin que le repas de nos clients soit mémorable.

Le rôle d'expert en Service client signifie être sur vos pieds et vous déplacer (se lever, s’asseoir ou marcher pendant une longue période de temps); se déplacer sur des surfaces en pente, inégales ou glissantes; gérer le menu (lire et vérifier l'information visuellement), et mettre la main à la pâte dans votre travail (déplacer, soulever, porter, pousser, tirer et placer des objets pesant jusqu’à 25 livres (11,4 kg) sans assistance et 50 livres (22,7 kg) avec assistance; atteindre les objets au-dessus de la tête et au-dessous des genoux, y compris se plier, faire des rotations du corps, tirer et se baisser).

Position Summary
Our jobs aren’t just about placing golf clubs on a cart. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with golfing on the side. Our Golf Experience Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure guests enjoy their round from start to finish. Whether transporting clubs to/from guest vehicles, assisting with carts and equipment, cleaning and storing clubs, restocking golf carts, or starting and monitoring pace of play, the Golf Experience Expert makes transactions on the course feel like part of the experience.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Golf Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing scorecards (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance and 100 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping; grasp, turn, and manipulate objects of varying size and weight, requiring fine motor skills and hand-eye coordination). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Golf Experience Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Related Work Experience: No related work experience.

Position Summary
Our jobs aren’t just about putting food on the table that our guests will enjoy until they ask for their bill. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with food and drinks on the side. Our Guest Service Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their meal. Whether setting tables, communicating with the kitchen, interacting and serving guests, or cleaning work areas and supplies, the Guest Service Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Position Summary
Our jobs aren’t just about putting food on the table that our guests will enjoy until they ask for their bill. Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with food and drinks on the side. Our Guest Service Experts take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their meal. Whether setting tables, communicating with the kitchen, interacting and serving guests, or cleaning work areas and supplies, the Guest Service Expert makes transactions feel like part of the experience.
No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Guest Service Experts will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing the menu (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance and 50 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Guest Service Experts – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida).

Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.
Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

Notre travail ne se limite pas à mettre de la nourriture sur la table dont nos clients se régaleront jusqu'à ce qu'ils demandent leur facture. Nous devons avant tout bâtir une expérience unique et mémorable – en plus de la nourriture et des boissons. Nos experts en matière de soutien au Service client font preuve d'initiative et offrent un vaste éventail de services afin que les opérations de restauration de nos clients se déroulent sans effort. Qu'il s'agisse de préparer les tables, d'aider en cuisine, de nettoyer les aires de travail ou de regarnir les stocks de fourniture, l'expert en matière de soutien au Service client apporte l'aide requise pour permettre aux transactions de faire partie de l'expérience.
Peu importe votre poste, certaines choses sont essentielles pour réussir - la création d'un lieu de travail sécuritaire, le respect des politiques et des procédures de la société, le respect des normes de qualité et veiller à ce que votre uniforme, votre apparence personnelle et vos communications soient professionnels. Le rôle d'expert en matière de soutien au Service client signifie être sur vos pieds et vous déplacer (se lever, s’asseoir ou marcher pendant une longue période de temps); se déplacer sur des surfaces en pente, inégales ou glissantes; gérer le menu (lire et vérifier l'information visuellement), et mettre la main à la pâte dans votre travail (déplacer, soulever, porter, pousser, tirer et placer des objets pesant jusqu’à 25 livres (11,4 kg) sans assistance et 50 livres (22,7 kg) avec assistance; atteindre les objets au-dessus de la tête et au-dessous des genoux, y compris se plier, faire des rotations du corps, tirer et se baisser). Il est essentiel que les experts en matière de soutien au Service client exécutent toutes ces tâches à la perfection (et toute autre tâche raisonnable qui leur est assignée) - ainsi, nos clients seront toujours satisfaits et notre entreprise continuera de prospérer.

Emergency Grants Manager GOMA, DRC
About Mercy Corps
Mercy Corps is a leading global organization powered by the belief that a better world is possible. In disaster, in hardship, in more than 40 countries around the world, we partner to put bold solutions into action — helping people triumph over adversity and build stronger communities from within.
Now, and for the future.
The Program / Department / Team (Program / Department Summary)
Mercy Corps is an international non-governmental humanitarian and development organization. It has been operational in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) since August 2007 and currently employs more than 400 national and expatriate staff. Mercy Corps’ country office is based in Goma, with sub- offices/bases in Beni (North Kivu Province); Bukavu, Kavumu, and Uvira (South Kivu Province); Bunia and Mambasa (Ituri Province); as well as Tshikapa, Kalonda Ouest, and Ndjoko Mpunda in Kasaï Province.
In 2023, we reached nearly two million people through our key activities in the DRC, combining long- term development programs with emergency humanitarian response to: 1) improve water service delivery and ensure equitable access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services in both urban and rural areas (WASH); 2) enhance food security and nutrition; and 3) promote diversified livelihoods, economic recovery, and development. Mercy Corps DRC’s humanitarian programs specifically aim to assist populations affected by conflict and crisis in eastern Congo through unconditional cash assistance and emergency WASH support to displaced persons, returnees, and host families.
Mercy Corps DRC implements ambitious programs designed to strengthen the ability of the most vulnerable people to overcome challenges and build their resilience in the face of one of the world’s most significant humanitarian crises. In this context, Mercy Corps DRC is seeking a Grants Manager for the Emergency Program for its Goma office.
The Position (General Position Summary)
As a member of Mercy Corps’ DRC Emergency Team, the Emergency Grants Manager will work closely with the Emergency Programs Director (EPD), the SAFER Consortium Director, and the Deputy Emergency Grants Manager to ensure the delivery of high-quality and impactful programming within Mercy Corps DRC’s emergency response portfolio. The position will contribute to humanitarian efforts across the DRC by supporting the implementation of life-saving interventions, including those under the multi-million-dollar, multi-donor funded SAFER program — a consortium of international NGOs working together to promote a rapid, principled, efficient, and effective response to humanitarian needs.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative, Inc. (CHAI) is a global health organization committed to our mission of saving lives and reducing the burden of disease in low-and middle-income countries. We work at the invitation of governments to support them and the private sector to create and sustain high-quality health systems.
CHAI was founded in 2002 in response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic with the goal of dramatically reducing the price of life-saving drugs and increasing access to these medicines in the countries with the highest burden of the disease. Over the following two decades, CHAI has expanded its focus. Today, along with HIV, we work in conjunction with our partners to prevent and treat infectious diseases such as COVID-19, malaria, tuberculosis, and hepatitis. Our work has also expanded into cancer, diabetes, hypertension, and other non-communicable diseases, and we work to accelerate the rollout of lifesaving vaccines, reduce maternal and child mortality, combat chronic malnutrition, and increase access to assistive technology. We are investing in horizontal approaches to strengthen health systems through programs in human resources for health, digital health, and health financing. With each new and innovative program, our strategy is grounded in maximizing sustainable impact at scale, ensuring that governments lead the solutions, that programs are designed to scale nationally, and learnings are shared globally.
At CHAI, our people are our greatest asset, and none of this work would be possible without their talent, time, dedication and passion for our mission and values. We are a highly diverse team of enthusiastic individuals across 40 countries with a broad range of skillsets and life experiences.

Nuestro trabajo no consiste únicamente en servir comida en una mesa para que la disfruten nuestros huéspedes hasta el momento de pedir la cuenta. Además de eso, queremos crear una experiencia que sea memorable y única (dejando a un lado la comida y la bebida). Nuestros Expertos de servicio al huésped toman la iniciativa a la hora de ofrecer toda una serie de servicios orientados a que el huésped disfrute la experiencia. Ya sea cuando ponen las mesas, hablan con cocina, interactúan y sirven a los huéspedes o limpian las áreas de trabajo y de almacenamiento, los Expertos de servicio al huésped consiguen que las transacciones formen parte de la experiencia del huésped.
Al margen de cuál sea su puesto, hay una serie de cosas fundamentales para el éxito (crear un espacio de trabajo seguro, seguir las directrices y procedimientos de la compañía, mantener los estándares de calidad y asegurarse de que su uniforme, apariencia personal y comunicación sea profesional. Los Expertos de servicio al huésped están siempre en marcha (se ponen de pie, se sientan, andan durante largos ratos, se mueven por superficies con pendiente, que no siempre son uniformes y que a veces resbalan), revisan el menú (lo leen y verifican la información) y se implican en todo tipo de tareas (mover cosas, levantar, llevar, empujar y colocar objetos de menos de 50 libras sin ayuda; deben llegar a lugares altos y agacharse, y deben hacer movimientos que les obligan a doblar las rodillas, girarse, estirar y encorvarse). Es fundamental que los Expertos de servicio al huésped hagan siempre bien esas tareas (y otras tareas razonables que se les solicite) para que los huéspedes estén satisfechos y el hotel funcione.

Trainer - Trading Services
Job Description
As a Trainer, you will be essential in the facilitation and delivery of T&D activity across our Client Servicing teams. You will report into the T&D Lead.
So, who are we?
We’re IG Group. No, not Instagram – though we're a pretty big deal ourselves.
We’re a global, FTSE 250-listed company made up of a collection of progressive fintech brands in the world of online trading and investing. The best part? We’ve snapped up many awards for our top-class platforms, forward-thinking products, and incredible employee experiences.
We believe in financial freedom. And our purpose is to help ambitious people achieve it. Around 400,000 people use our groundbreaking technology and forward-thinking platforms to trade the financial products they know and love.
Did we mention we have offices in 18 countries? Yes, when you join IG Group, you'll have the chance to work across multiple brands, with people all over the world. Join us for an exciting future and let’s innovate together!
Your role in the Team
The T&D team are responsible for the creation, management and delivery of all training and developmental activity across Client Servicing teams. This includes the major training milestones of; onboarding, APT & TET.
Reporting into the T&D Lead, you’ll play a fundamental role in creating, designing and delivering T&D activity, including the admin elements of the role. You’ll be a representative of the T&D department and will attend meetings, engage stakeholders and prepare presentations/reports accordingly.

You’re also a confident, creative thinker with a knack for innovating. We know that you know every problem has a solution. Here, you can try new ideas, and lead the way in creating inspiring experiences for our clients and everyone around you.
We don’t fit the corporate stereotype. If you want to work for a traditional, suit-and-tie corporate that just gives you a pay cheque at the end of the month, we might not be for you. But, if you have that IG Group energy and you can stand behind what we believe in, let’s raise the bar together.
What You’ll Need For This Role

Stretch yourself, challenge your self-beliefs and go for the things you dream of. With internal and external learning opportunities, and the tools to help you skyrocket to success, we’ll support you all the way.

Pension, Insurance and Medical plans
Career-focused technical and leadership training including free access to LinkedIn Learning
Contribution to Gym Memberships and more

Where you’ll work
We follow a hybrid working model; we reckon it’s the best of both worlds. This model also feeds into our secret ingredients for innovation: diversity, flexibility, and close connection. Plus, you’ll be welcomed into a diverse and inclusive workforce with a lot of creative energy.
Ask our employees what their favourite thing is about working at IG, and you’ll hear an echo of ‘our culture’! That’s because you can come to work as your authentic self. The things that make you, you – like your ethnicity, sexual orientation, faith, age, gender identity/expression or physical capacity – can bring a fresh perspective or new skill to our business.
That’s why we welcome people from various walks of life; and anyone who wants to help us realise our vision and strategy.
So, if you’re keen to connect with our values, and lead the charge on innovation, you know what to do.

Position at GVW Group, LLC
Do you want to be an executive recruiter WITHIN THE gvw group, LLC?
Can you be comfortable being uncomfortable? Are you fine with always speaking your mind?
Can you lead, execute, and stay focused despite many distractions, and do the work yourself if needed?
At GVW Group, we fight for the customer’s needs. We invest in and grow businesses that disrupt their industries by putting the customers’ needs first. From big data to industrial manufacturing, we deliver tools that transform the work of the people that use them.
It takes a special kind of person to be a part of this business in transformation. We are privately owned and expect our team members to act with an owner mindset: Relentless about creating value for the customer. Dogged about finding efficiencies and eliminating waste. Standing arm in arm with the rest of the team until the job is done—and ready to do it again the next day, with a smile. It is not easy do things differently. But we do it—because we are passionate about improving our business and the lives of the people who use our tools.
