About Our Hiring Process
Our recruitment process is tailored to do our best to avoid that you or us realize that we’re not a perfect fit. Every step serves a purpose and will allow us to get to know you better as much as it’ll help you understand more where you’ll be stepping in.
We also want you to have time to ask all of your questions regarding the mission, the long-term vision of your team and the company, our values, with the relevant interlocutor in front of you.
But maybe YOU WONDER WHAT’S OUR STORY ? 😉
At Paradox, we are convinced that people do not want “just a job” anymore.
We are all craving to have an impact through our professional journey. Some want to start their own venture, some want to become an intrapreneur in their current organization, some others just want their day-to-day tasks to have more meaning.
🎯 PARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.
But where do we start?
If you have an interest in personal development, you probably already know that:
Making things happen is a real struggle when you don’t know what truly inspires you and how to get there ;
Available resources are either boring 😴 or full of crazy unsubstantiated theories 🤪.
It needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!
⭐️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.
In other words, we want to make personal growth
as entertaining as watching Netflix.
How, you might be wondering?
We travel the world and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs (Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar), world athletes (Tony Parker - Hall of fame NBA Player, Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer), and artists (Gad Elmaleh - Comedian, Franck Dubosc, Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix) ✊;
We reverse engineer their strategies for achieving success and fulfillment and lean on the latest researches about neurosciences ⚙️;
We deliver trainings & educational contents around Power Skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management, etc.), self-growth and performance, through a balanced set of e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos 💡.
From one well-known Founder to a team of +45 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.
🔥 TOGETHER, WE ARE DRIVEN BY ONE DREAM:
Helping 100 000 people achieve their dream and display their pictures on what we call the “100 000 dreams wall” ;
Giving our clients access to constant personal growth by reinventing their learning experience ;

Notre travail ne se limite pas à offrir à nos clients une chambre propre et un lit fraîchement fait. Nous devons avant tout bâtir une expérience unique et mémorable. Nos experts en Environnement client sont compétents dans un vaste éventail de tâches d'entretien ménager et sont chargés de maintenir l'apparence et la propreté de l'ensemble de l'hôtel.

At Paradox, we are convinced that greatness is trainable.
That’s why
we want to empower people at scale, by leveraging cutting edge technologies like AI, and crafting user experiences with outstanding aesthetics.
We do that by merging :
Human Intelligence (coaches, peers, and mentors)
Structured Intelligence (protocols, mental models, rituals),
Technological Intelligence (AI personalization, feedback loops, adaptive journeys)
To create one seamless ecosystem:
Paradox OS
.
Your mission is to turn this ecosystem into
beautifully orchestrated learning arcs
that feel alive, cinematic, and deeply human.
This is why we are looking for a LXD to make Paradox a category-defining global brand loved for its learning experiences.
This is a full time position from our beautiful offices in Dubai, Paris or Lisbon or remotely anywhere in the world.
OUR BELIEFS
We believe self-help is broken.
Most learning platforms are used the same way : consuming generic theories, getting quick highs, ending with no real change.
At
Paradox
, we believe people deserve more.
More than content. More than motivation.
They deserve a
system that knows them
, one that adapts, challenges, and grows with them.
At Paradox,
learning = transformation.
We believe that technology can do more than entertain or save time. It can
translate insight into transformation
, through
AI personalization, lean experimentation, and deep psychological understanding
.
Because learning shouldn’t just make you feel inspired for a day, it should
change how you live, think, and create.
OUR VISION
At Paradox, we want to re-invent how people grow.
We do not build another course or coaching app but the Operating System for Greatness.
Founded by David Laroche, a creator followed by over 2 million people and known for his interviews with icons like Tony Parker, Mike Horn, Richard Branson, and Gad Elmaleh, Paradox aims to build something that will live beyond any individual (including its founder), for decades to come.
Our ambition is to compete with players like Mindvalley (150M ARR), but with a sharper vision, grounded protocols for achievers, people who want more for their life, refusing mediocrity.
To do that, we bring together designers, tech, coaches, and filmmakers to create learning experiences that are cinematic, precise, and effective.
We move fast, aim high, and hold ourselves to the standards of Apple, Spotify, and MasterClass. No fluff, focused on meaningful impact.
Get obsessed with transforming our clients’ lives, treat it like a science, build, measure, improve
and let those transformations
be our
marketing.
While others hide their numbers, we want to let our results speak loudly for us.
YOUR MISSION 🚀
As our Learning Experience Designer, you’ll bridge
psychology, storytelling, and product design
to craft experiences that make people say:
“This didn’t just teach me, it
changed me.
”
Each cycle you lead will integrate:
Protocols : guided frameworks that rewire perception, emotion, and action.
Loops : adaptive, AI-powered coaching cycles that evolve with each user.
Personalization : experiences that feel uniquely theirs, every time.
AI agents : Specialised agents that enhance the student journey with the right actionable insights.
🎯 YOUR 4 MAIN MISSIONS
Learning Experience Architecture - Owns the full learning system, from architecture to execution
Design the journey, not just the content and lesson.
Script learning experiences that engage both heart and brain: Each word, exercise, and soundscape must serve transformation, not just knowledge.
Ensure every feature supports the evolution of the Paradox ecosystem: Loops, PX Agents, Protocols, Membership.
Craft a premium, high-impact course experience
Craft new courses with experts.
Co-craft courses with top performers, translating their genius into cinematic, science-based learning journeys.
Lead the end-to-end design of the course, from initial strategy to final content delivery.
Own scripting, copywriting, and the creation of educational assets (e.g., learning modules, assessments, reflection prompts, supplemental materials).
Conduct desk and user research to inform course goals, learner personas, and curriculum structure.
Craft AI Conversations and Loops
Write and optimize prompt chains, refine tone and flow until every exchange feels human and transformative.
Review conversations with AI to refine the agents.
Analyze, Measure, Iterate for Transformation and Stickiness
Define KPIs of transformation (not just completion).
Iterate on the course using learner data, feedback, and performance metrics.
Be obsessed with user problems : talk to users weekly, analyze patterns, and identify where transformation breaks.
Apply principles from habit formation, self-determination theory, and behavioral triggers to drive daily practice and retention.
THE IDEAL CANDIDATE 😍
Experience :
3–6 years as in Learning Design, Instructional Design, or Experience Design (EdTech, Coaching, or Transformational Education preferred).
You’ve shipped at least one major feature or product end-to-end, and can show measurable results.
Comfortable with AI tools, Figma.
Proven track record of designing and delivering digital learning experiences across a variety of asset types (e.g. video, written articles, assessments, interactive experiences, etc.).
Portfolio of one or more “cinematic / narrative-rich” courses or learning programs (e.g. not just corporate training, but premium courses).
Traits :
Craft-obsessed: You get things done, you love to work much beyond 9-5, you have a doer mentality, a bias for outcomes and want to be a beast in your field.
Strong writing skills: You’re a strong editorial thinker with experience producing high-quality content for external audiences.
Strong aesthetic sensibility: You care how the course “feels”.
User and Impact Obsessed: You think in outcomes, not outputs, you care about transformation.
Critical Thinker: You can turn a vague problem into a clear hypothesis, You can challenge your own assumptions, break models, and rebuild them grounded in real data, field insights, and lived experience.
Digital and AI savvy: You’re able to build AI Agents (if not, you demonstrate ability to learn while applying).
Language
French
: native
English
: Fluent English, you can hold a conversation on specific details with English-speaking colleagues.
Our chosen language for written communication is English.
IT MIGHT NOT BE FOR YOU
Until you’ve felt what a perfect loop, prompt, or emotional shift sounds like, you can’t systematize it.
The early versions of PX Agents and Loops are language-sensitive.
The difference between “What did you feel?” and “What are you feeling?” changes the user’s emotional state.
That requires someone who rewrites lines several times, not someone who just optimizes the spreadsheet.
If you think it’s overthinking, this won’t fit.
❌ If you want to design a program on a subject like Critical Thinking, Negotiation without reading four of the best books on it, this is not for you.
❌ If you need clarity before chaos, wrong place.
❌ If you prefer balance over intensity, wrong season.
❌Surface-level Vision Alignment
:
you like the idea of Paradox but doesn’t want to
get
the depth. Paradox is design-led; you must
touch the product
, not just manage it.

2025-12-27,December,Enterprise Account Executive,Canonical,"Cairo, Cairo, Egypt","This is a general track role, hiring for opportunities across all levels of seniority in our Sales Teams.
Apply here if you believe you possess outstanding revenue generating experience from the Technology industry.
Open source software is the new default in the enterprise, and Canonical is the new challenger to major enterprise software vendors.
We deliver better open source from the data center to cloud and edge. Our Linux distribution Ubuntu is now the leading platform for public cloud compute, and the favorite platform for software engineers, data scientists and AI developers. Our mission is to accelerate the adoption and quality of open source globally, and our goal is to ship the most software on the planet by cores. A tidal wave of open source innovation is the next phase of the entire enterprise software industry, and we aim to be the most compelling way to ride that wave.
Our customers include Global 500 enterprises and startups. We are expanding our product range from the base operating system - Ubuntu - to full enterprise solutions in infrastructure and applications. We can deliver software defined storage, private cloud solutions, container runtime environments, as well as databases, message queues, identity, observability, analytics, machine learning and web publishing capabilities. Customers love the idea that they can get security compliance and support for everything open source from a single company. Our goal is to have more solutions on tap than any other vendor, and we have built unique capabilities to make that possible across every cloud, every class of compute and every category of application.
Canonical provides licensed enterprise software products, commercial support, managed services, consulting and training services to customers who are deploying Ubuntu or open source applications on the cloud, in their data center, or to the connected device and IoT ecosystem. We are just over 1,000 colleagues in 70+ countries and $250m in revenue, profitable, on a steady but relentless growth trajectory. We are almost entirely distributed, with leadership spread across many countries. We believe that talent is equally distributed across the globe, and we are excited to hire, develop, promote and ultimately trust a diverse group of exceptional leads to build the best, not biggest, enterprise software company.
We hire carefully and deliberately; our selection process is long and requires substantial work from applicants. It will take successful applicants three to six months to secure an offer. This is not a place to apply if you are in a rush to find a position, it is a worthwhile place to apply if you are ambitious and long-term in your thinking about your career and the dynamics which move the world forward. If you see clearly the rise of open source, and you understand the drivers of enterprise procurement and technical decision making, then you will understand why Canonical has such a tremendous long term advantage. You will also understand, given the ferocity of competition and the challenges of competing in a market of giants, that we have to set a very high bar for hiring and performance. In order to be a world leading company we select for exceptional ability as well as character, and then provide an environment which promotes teamwork and celebrates diligence, collaboration and effectiveness. All of those are easy to say but hard to do - at Canonical we are willing to be uncomfortable in pursuit of that excellence.
In building our sales team, we look for five things:
Empathy for the customer - a real understanding of customer needs, industry-specific challenges, and a desire to help customers solve their business problems
High intellect - the ability to learn quickly, understand very complex subjects, and communicate clearly to build trust and confidence
Passion for technology - a fascination with the state of the art from brilliant people solving hard problems, and fierce competition for large prizes
Teamwork - a willingness to help others, to collaborate well with people from different disciplines, and to balance personal and team ambitions
Energy - the drive to motivate oneself and others to achieve the best result for the team and our customers
Ubuntu is already very widely adopted which gives us a credible basis for conversations in the market. Nevertheless, it requires real work for sales professionals to build on that adoption to create trusted and profitable commercial relationships with the enterprises in their territory. Our product managers and marketing teams run campaigns to generate awareness, engagement and leads, but you will need to go beyond managing inbound interest to develop the potential of your territory. You will need judgement as to which industries and companies are ready to go deeper with open source and Canonical, and energy to develop relationships in advance of proven interest. We expect professional practice, territory and account planning, as well as clear, complete and continuous reporting on pipeline status and activity, using standard professional tools.
The successful candidate will carry an annual bookings quota within their assigned territory. They should be able to travel regionally for client engagement, industry conferences, and internationally for company events twice a year. They will be expected to demonstrate professionalism and effectiveness, to prospect accounts for new business, maintain and develop existing relationships, and work with colleagues and partners on account strategy. They must be comfortable selling enterprise software, open source, cloud, virtualization, container technologies and technical software solutions to senior levels of the enterprise.
Location: We are expanding our sales organisation globally and have open roles in every region.
What your day will look like
Represent the company, its solutions and software, in your territory
Build and execute a territory plan to prioritize outreach and prospecting
Develop new pipeline through outreach, prospecting, local marketing, and industry events
Close contracts to meet and exceed quarterly and annual bookings targets
Be mindful and proactive in achieving tactical and strategic objectives
Manage customer relationships and interactions through all stages of the sales cycle
Work with field engineers to propose solutions that solve our customers' business problems
Work with customer success to identify growth opportunities
Maintain accurate pipeline data and forecasts within Salesforce
Establish productive professional relationships with key influencers and decision makers
What we are looking for in you
Bachelor's level degree, preferably in engineering or computer science
Experience of open source technology and solutions
Detail oriented with effective follow-up
Experience in enterprise software or technology sales planning and execution
Track record of achievement in sales targets and new account wins
Self-discipline and motivation to be successful in a distributed team
Professional written and spoken English, as well as any language that may be appropriate for your target market
Ability to travel for customer engagements, industry events and company events
Additional Skills Of Interest
Specific vertical experience, in particular finance, telco, health, energy, public sector, tech
Experience speaking at conferences or industry events
What we offer you
We consider geographical location, experience, and performance when shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven commission structure. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.
Distributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person
Personal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year
Annual compensation review
Recognition rewards
Annual holiday leave
Maternity and paternity leave
Employee Assistance Program
Opportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues
Priority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events
About Canonical
Canonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do.

Large‑scale language models are evolving from clever chatbots into powerful engines of scientific discovery. With high‑quality training data, tomorrow’s AI can democratize world‑class education, keep pace with cutting‑edge research, and streamline software development for engineers everywhere. That training data begins with you—we need your expertise to help power the next generation of AI.
We’re looking for coding specialists who live and breathe algorithms, data structures, software architecture, frontend and backend development, cloud infrastructure, and systems programming—and who can do so fluently in Arabic. You’ll challenge advanced language models on topics like asynchronous programming, RESTful API integration, memory management, object-oriented design, secure coding practices, and debugging distributed systems—documenting every failure mode so we can harden model reasoning.
On a typical day, you will converse with the model on software engineering tasks and technical scenarios in Arabic, verify logical accuracy and coding fluency, assess naturalness and correctness of Arabic language usage, capture reproducible error traces, and suggest improvements to our prompt engineering and evaluation metrics.
A bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD in computer science, software engineering, or a closely related technical field is ideal; real-world coding experience, technical writing in Arabic, or open-source contributions signal fit. Clear, metacognitive communication—“showing your work”—is essential.
Ready to turn your coding and Arabic language expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.

About Our Hiring Process
Our recruitment process is tailored to do our best to avoid that you or us realize that we’re not a perfect fit. Every step serves a purpose and will allow us to get to know you better as much as it’ll help you understand more where you’ll be stepping in.
We also want you to have time to ask all of your questions regarding the mission, the long-term vision of your team and the company, our values, with the relevant interlocutor in front of you.
But maybe YOU WONDER WHAT’S OUR STORY ? 😉
At Paradox, we are convinced that people do not want “just a job” anymore.
We are all craving to have an impact through our professional journey. Some want to start their own venture, some want to become an intrapreneur in their current organization, some others just want their day-to-day tasks to have more meaning.
🎯 PARADOX HAS ONE GOAL: TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO LIVE THEIR TRUE AMBITIONS.
But where do we start?
If you have an interest in personal development, you probably already know that:
Making things happen is a real struggle when you don’t know what truly inspires you and how to get there ;
Available resources are either boring 😴 or full of crazy unsubstantiated theories 🤪.
It needs to change, and we’re here to make it happen!
⭐️ OUR AMBITION IS TO MAKE SUCCESS THE ONLY POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR OUR CLIENTS (WHATEVER SUCCESS MEANS FOR THEM), BY CRAFTING INNOVATIVE & CAPTIVATING BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIENCES.
In other words, we want to make personal growth
as entertaining as watching Netflix.
How, you might be wondering?
We travel the world and surround ourselves with top entrepreneurs (Richard Branson - Founder of Virgin, Marc Simoncini - Founder of Meeting, Fred Mazzella - Founder of BlablaCar), world athletes (Tony Parker - Hall of fame NBA Player, Frederick Bousquet - World record in 50m free swimming, Frank Leboeuf - WorldCup Footballer), and artists (Gad Elmaleh - Comedian, Franck Dubosc, Barry Osborne - Producer of Lord of the Rings and Matrix) ✊;
We reverse engineer their strategies for achieving success and fulfillment and lean on the latest researches about neurosciences ⚙️;
We deliver trainings & educational contents around Power Skills (critical thinking, productivity, leadership, public speaking, coaching, stress management, etc.), self-growth and performance, through a balanced set of e-learning programs, events and edutainment videos 💡.
From one well-known Founder to a team of +45 people today (and counting!), this approach has paid off and enabled us to exceed 2 million followers on social networks, and to have thousands of people attending our online events and training courses.
🔥 TOGETHER, WE ARE DRIVEN BY ONE DREAM:
Helping 100 000 people achieve their dream and display their pictures on what we call the “100 000 dreams wall” ;
Giving our clients access to constant personal growth by reinventing their learning experience ;
Leverage AI and other technology to provide an outstanding customized experience to millions of people for them to transform their lives.

Background
Sudan is enduring one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises, remaining at the top of the IRC’s emergency watchlist for two consecutive years.

Despite repeated ceasefire announcements, the conflict has persisted for nearly two and a half years, crippling health services—over 70% of facilities are non-functional or overwhelmed—and leaving 30.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid. Acute food insecurity affects 25 million people, including 770,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition, while damage to infrastructure, supply shortages, and restricted humanitarian access continue to obstruct relief efforts.

2025-12-27,December,Supply Chain / Industrial Engineering Intern — Autonomous Systems,VistaDeep,"Tunis, Tunisia","VistaDeep is an
AI Operating System for self-adapting, autonomous supply chains
, designed as a foundational intelligence layer for systems that must evolve in complex, changing environments. It supports a shift from reactive processes to continuously learning, adaptive supply networks.
🧠 What you will work on
1) Multi-tier value-chain modelling
Model real industries as graphs of suppliers, factories, parts, flows and dependencies.
2) GNN-driven simulation
Use Graph Neural Networks to simulate how shocks move through the network, running large numbers of what-if scenarios (factory shutdowns, logistics failures, geopolitical events) to see how nodes, volumes and lead-times are affected.
3) AI agent behaviour under stress
For every simulation, run the AI mitigation agent and observe how it reacts — what actions it proposes, which trade-offs it makes.
4) Iterative reinforcement loop
Use those outcomes to iteratively reinforce and refine the agent’s reasoning and decision logic, so it becomes better at handling future disruptions over time.
🛠 Who should apply
Students interested in: Supply Chain, Industrial Engineering, Operations research, AI, Graph Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, complex systems.
No coding is required. The work is done by running, testing, evaluating and refining models in VistaDeep Platform.
🎓 Ideal academic profiles
This role is a strong fit for candidates studying or graduating in:
Industrial Engineering
Supply Chain Engineering
Operations Research
Systems Engineering
Complex Systems or Decision Science
🌍 Why VistaDeep
You’ll be helping build autonomous, learning systems that run the world’s supply chains.
If you want to work on AI that reasons, simulates, decides and adapts, this is it.

We're making Africa the first cashless continent.

Parents spend hours waiting in line to pay school fees in cash.
We're solving this by building financial services that just work: no account fees, instantly available, and accepted everywhere. In places where electricity, water and roads don't always work, you can still send money with Wave.

Background
The threats against the UN and UNDP requires an approach that manages in-country security risks while enabling UNDP’s programming. This necessitates the analysis of threats, the assessment of risks and the implementation of security risk management measures to reduce risks to acceptable levels.
UNDP programmes, considering the development needs of countries, are often formulated in the context of coherent regions, referred to as Regional Bureau. Security support delivery to countries and regions can better be improved with services more closely situated to such regions and countries. UNDP service delivery can be enhanced by having a broader footprint, more responsive and better-informed interaction with its clients.

Context and purpose of the job
The Horti-LIFE GREEN GROWTH Description of the Action (DoA) promotes the integration of Productive Use of Renewable Energy (PURE) solutions into Ethiopia’s horticultural value chains. Supported by the EU Delegation and the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Ethiopia, it aligns with Specific Objective 2 of the EU Action Document for Green Business Development in sustainable Agro-food systems. Building on lessons from the Dutch-funded Horti-LIFE project, where PURE was not included, the DoA responds to growing demand driven by rising fuel costs, limited fertiliser access, soil degradation, and post-harvest losses. The project aims to enhance smallholder productivity and resilience through PURE solutions such as solar irrigation, biodigesters, solar cold storage, and solar dryers. These technologies improve soil health, water efficiency, year-round production, and reduce post-harvest losses amid climate variability. Given Ethiopia’s security volatility, the project will apply adaptive management to ensure conflict-sensitive and equitable implementation across four target regions. Gender Equality and Social Inclusion (GESI) will be embedded to ensure women, youth, and marginalised groups access technologies, training, finance, and markets.
The project also strengthens local private sector capacity to supply PURE solutions, leveraging Horti-LIFE III platforms including Farmer Field Schools, (A)-TVETs, and MSME networks. The Horti-LIFE Green Growth project is implemented in Sidama, South Ethiopia, Central Ethiopia and Southwest Ethiopia.
In the Ethiopian context, promoting PURE result chains at both demand and supply side requires financial mechanisms that align with the country's unique socio-economic conditions, agricultural practices, and energy access challenges. Ethiopia has a large rural population, limited access to modern energy, and a strong reliance on agriculture, making tailored financial solutions critical for promotion of PURE technologies.

The Market Activation and Support Facility (MASF)

This will be complemented by activities related to demonstrations showcasing cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) to highlight value and encourage investments into these PURE solutions.
Pre-Financed Catalytic Grants – Strategic funding to strengthen company operations and business models. This can support service delivery expansion, inventory buildup, or logistical subsidies for reaching underserved areas, laying the groundwork for long-term market sustainability.
Innovation Grant Facility (IGF)

We fight for solutions that adapt to the individual’s needs, beliefs, behaviors and aspirations. And we commit to doing this in every aspect of our work for clients and their consumers.

2025-12-27,December,Senior Sales Development Representative,Mainspring,South Africa,"Stop Earning Rands. Start Earning Dollars.
THE OPPORTUNITY
We are
Mainspring
, a US-based financial technology firm. We provide Payment Processing, Payroll, and Time & Attendance solutions to American small businesses.
We are building an elite
""Special Forces"" Sales Team
in South Africa. We are not looking for call center agents who read scripts like robots. We are looking for
Hunters
.
Most sales jobs in South Africa cap your growth, pay you in a depreciating currency, and treat you like a number. We are different.
We pay a
premium US salary
to secure the top 1% of talent in the country.
THE MISSION
Your objective is
Displacement
. You will call business owners in the United States (restaurants, retailers, auto shops) who already have a provider. You must cut through the noise, build instant credibility, and book a meeting for our Senior Closers.
The Grind:
You will dial 80–100 numbers a day.
The Reality:
You will get hung up on. You will face rejection.
The Test:
Can you hear ""No"" 99 times, keep your energy high, and book the meeting on the 100th call?
WHO YOU ARE
We don't care about your degree. We care about your
Intelligence
and your
Grit
.
Fluid Intelligence:
You can calculate a merchant's savings on the fly. You can understand complex financial concepts (Interchange-Plus pricing, Tax burdens) and can pivot a conversation instantly when a prospect throws a curveball.
Unshakeable Grit:
You view sales as a sport. You don't take rejection personally; you take it professionally.
""Load Shedding Proof"":
You are a professional remote worker. You have your own
UPS/Inverter
and
Fiber Line
. You do not make excuses about power; you make calls.
Voice Command:
You speak native-level English with a clear, neutral accent. You sound like a high-level consultant, not a telemarketer.
THE OFFER
Elite Base Salary:
$2,000 USD / Month
(Fixed).
Context:
At current exchange rates, this places you in the top tier of earners for individual contributor roles in SA.
Aggressive Commission:
Earn
$50–$75 USD
for every qualified appointment that shows.
Earn a
$300 USD
bonus for every deal that closes.
Realistic On-Target Earnings (OTE): $3,500-$6,000 USD / Month.
Lifestyle Friendly Hours:
3:00 PM – 11:00 PM SAST
(8:00 AM – 4:00 PM EST).
Why this matters:
You skip the morning rush hour traffic and have your days free for the gym, family, or personal growth, while avoiding the brutal ""graveyard shift"" of many call centers.
Stability:
This is a long-term role. We are looking for career partners, not gig workers.
REQUIREMENTS
Minimum 1 year of high-velocity outbound cold calling experience (US, UK, or Australian markets preferred).
A quiet home office environment (no background noise).

2025-12-27,December,SWE Infrastructure Specialist (Java) – Freelance AI Trainer Project,"Meridial Marketplace, by Invisible",South Africa,"Are you a Java-focused software engineer with strong infrastructure and systems expertise eager to help shape how AI understands large-scale software systems? As language models are increasingly applied to enterprise environments, their ability to reason about performance, reliability, and cloud architecture depends on high-quality expert guidance. That training data begins with experienced engineers like you.
We’re seeking SWE Infrastructure Specialists fluent in Java with deep knowledge of systems thinking, architectural design, performance engineering, and quality assurance. You’ll challenge advanced AI models on complex infrastructure scenarios involving JVM-based services, distributed systems, cloud-native deployments, and enterprise-grade architectures, while documenting where models struggle to reason about correctness, scalability, and operational behavior.
On a typical day, you will engage the model on Java-centric infrastructure and platform engineering tasks, verify architectural decisions related to concurrency, latency, throughput, and resource utilization, assess infrastructure and application-level testing strategies, analyze deployment and reliability risks, capture reproducible failure modes, and provide structured feedback to improve model evaluation and reasoning frameworks.
A bachelor’s, master’s, or PhD in computer science, software engineering, or a related technical discipline is preferred. Hands-on experience with enterprise Java systems, cloud infrastructure, platform engineering, or SRE- and DevOps-adjacent roles is highly valued. Strong written communication and the ability to clearly explain system behavior and design decisions are essential.
Ready to turn your engineering expertise into the knowledge base for tomorrow’s AI? Apply today and start teaching the model that will teach the world.
We offer a pay range of $80-to-$150 per hour, with the exact rate determined after evaluating your experience, expertise, and geographic location. Final offer amounts may vary from the pay range listed above. As a contractor you’ll supply a secure computer and high-speed internet; company-sponsored benefits such as health insurance and PTO do not apply.
